          <h2>What is Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)?</h2>
          <p>
            Indoor air quality, IAQ is the quality of the air that we breathe inside the buildings such as homes,
             offices, schools, and other enclosed spaces. According to the Environmental Protection Agency indoor
              air can be 2 - 5 times more polluted than outside air. This is because indoor air can accumulate 
              various pollutants such as dust, allergens, mold spores, and chemicals from household products,
               which can lead to poor indoor air quality. 
          </p>

          <p>
            However, air quality can greatly vary depending on 
            the specific indoor and outdoor environments in question. Regular ventilation and cleaning can
             help improve indoor air quality.

          <h2>Negative Impacts of Poor Indoor Air Quality</h2>
          <p>
            Poor indoor air quality can cause respiratory issues, allergies,
            asthma, headaches, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Long-term
            exposure increases risks of chronic diseases like COPD, heart
            disease, and lung cancer. Vulnerable groups, including children, the
            elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions, are particularly
            affected. It can also spread infections and weaken immunity,
            emphasizing the need for proper ventilation and pollutant control.

        <h2>Causes of Poor Indoor Air Quality</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Inadequate ventilation: </strong>Insufficient fresh air due to
          poor ventilation system can build up air pollutants in the environment
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Indoor pollutants: </strong>The most common indoor pollutants include Mold Spores, Pet Dander,
           Radon, Secondhand Smoke, Lead Particles, Dust Mites, 
           Combustion Pollutants These come from burning
            materials or fuel for cooking, heating, or fireplace. 
            Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) These are gases that are released from certain solids or liquids, 
            including paints, pesticides, air fresheners, and dry-cleaned clothing, and
            Formaldehyde: This is a colorless, strong-smelling gas.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Tobacco smoke: </strong>People who smoke indoors releases,
          harmful chemicals, and toxins into the air, and can threaten the life
          of smokers, or non-smokers
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Moisture and mold: </strong>Excessive moisture in your home,
          or office, can lead to the growth of mold and mildew, which can
          release spores into the air and can lead to respiratory problems and
          allergies
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Building materials: </strong>Some of our building materials,
          including asbestos, lead-based paint, and formaldehyde-containing
          products, release some toxins in the air and pollute the environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>HVAC System Issues: </strong>Improperly maintained HVAC
          Systems and dirty coils causes poor air quality.
